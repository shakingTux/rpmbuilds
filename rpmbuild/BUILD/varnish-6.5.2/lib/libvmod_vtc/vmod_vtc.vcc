$Module vtc 3 "Utility module for varnishtest"

DESCRIPTION
===========

The goal for this VMOD is to provide VCL users and VMOD authors means to
test corner cases or reach certain conditions with varnishtest.

$Function VOID barrier_sync(STRING addr, DURATION timeout = 0)

When writing test cases, the most common pattern is to start a mock server
instance, a Varnish instance, and spin up a mock client. Those entities run
asynchronously, and others exist like background processes (``process``) or
log readers (``logexpect``). While you can synchronize with individual
entities and wait for their completion, you must use a barrier if you need
to synchronize two or more entities, or wait until a certain point instead
of completion.

Not only is it possible to synchronize between test entities, with the
``barrier_sync`` function you can even synchronize VCL code::

    sub vcl_recv {
	# wait for some barrier b1 to complete
	vtc.barrier_sync("${b1_sock}");
    }

If the function fails to synchronize with the barrier for some reason, or if
it reaches the optional timeout, it fails the VCL transaction.

MISCELLANEOUS
=============

$Function BACKEND no_backend()

Fails at backend selection.

$Function STEVEDORE no_stevedore()

Fails at storage selection.

$Function IP no_ip()

Returns a null IP address, not even a bogo_ip.

$Function VOID panic(STRANDS)

It can be useful to crash the child process in order to test the robustness
of a VMOD.

$Function VOID sleep(DURATION)

Block the current worker thread.

WORKSPACES
==========

It can be useful to put a workspace in a given state when testing corner
cases like resource exhaustion for a transaction, especially for VMOD
development. All functions available allow to pick which workspace you
need to tamper with, available values are ``client``, ``backend``, ``session``
and ``thread``.

$Function VOID workspace_alloc(ENUM { client, backend, session, thread },
	INT size)

Allocate and zero out memory from a workspace. A negative size will allocate
as much as needed to leave that many bytes free. The actual allocation size
may be higher to comply with memory alignment requirements of the CPU
architecture. A failed allocation fails the transaction.

$Function BYTES workspace_reserve(ENUM { client, backend, session, thread },
	INT size)

Attempt to reserve *size* bytes and release the reservation right
away. Return the size of the reservation.

See `vtc.workspace_alloc()`_ for semantics of the *size* argument.

$Function INT workspace_free(ENUM { client, backend, session, thread })

Find how much unallocated space there is left in a workspace.

$Function VOID workspace_snapshot(ENUM { client, backend, session, thread})

Snapshot a workspace. Only one snapshot may be active at a time and
each VCL can save only one snapshot, so concurrent tasks requiring
snapshots are not supported.

$Function VOID workspace_reset(ENUM { client, backend, session, thread })

Reset to the previous snapshot of a workspace, it must be the same workspace
too.

$Function BOOL workspace_overflowed(ENUM { client, backend, session, thread })

Find whether the workspace overflow mark is set or not.

$Function VOID workspace_overflow(ENUM { client, backend, session, thread })

Mark a workspace as overflowed.

$Function BLOB workspace_dump(
	ENUM { client, backend, session, thread },
	ENUM { s, f, r },
	BYTES off=0,
	BYTES len=64)

Return data from a workspace's ``s``, ``f``, or ``r`` pointer as a
blob. Data is copied onto the primary workspace to avoid it being
subsequently overwritten.

The maximum *len* is 1KB.

$Function INT typesize(STRING)

Returns the size in bytes of a collection of C-datatypes:

* ``'p'``: pointer
* ``'i'``: ``int``
* ``'d'``: ``double``
* ``'f'``: ``float``
* ``'l'``: ``long``
* ``'s'``: ``short``
* ``'z'``: ``size_t``
* ``'o'``: ``off_t``
* ``'j'``: ``intmax_t``

This can be useful for VMOD authors in conjunction with workspace operations.

$Function BLOB proxy_header(ENUM {v1,v2} version,
    IP client, IP server, STRING authority=0)

Format a proxy header of the given version ``v1`` or ``v2`` and
addresses (The VCL IP type also conatins the port number).

Optionally also send an authority TLV with version ``v2`` (ignored for
version ``v1``).

Candidate for moving into vmod_proxy, but there were concerns about
the interface design
