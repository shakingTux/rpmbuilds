Installing on RedHat or CentOS
==============================

Varnish is included in the `EPEL
<https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL>`_ repository, however due to
incompatible syntax changes in newer versions of Varnish, only older
versions are available.

We therefore recommend that you install the latest version directly from our repository, as described above.

Varnish Cache is packaged in RPMs for easy installation and upgrade on Red Hat
systems. The Varnish Cache project maintains official packages for the current
Enterprise Linux versions. Varnish Cache 6.x series are supported on el7 and el8.

We try to keep the latest version available as prebuilt RPMs (el7 and el8)
on `packagecloud.io/varnishcache <https://packagecloud.io/varnishcache/>`_.

Starting with el8 a DNF module will inhibit Varnish packages, and the solution
is to disable the module before installing::

    dnf module disable varnish

Official packages of 6
----------------------

Starting from Varnish Cache 5.0, we've simplified our packaging down to two:
the main package and a development package.

The official Varnish Cache repository is now hosted at Packagecloud.io.
Note that while Packagecloud.io provides Bash Script installs, we recommend
using the manual installation procedures.

Instructions for installing the official repository which contains the newest
Varnish Cache 6 release are available at:

* https://packagecloud.io/varnishcache/varnish60lts/install#manual-rpm

With the release of 6.0.2, users have to switch to switch repositories to get
the latest version.
Read more about this on `Release 6.0.2 </releases/rel6.0.2>`_.

External packaging
------------------

Varnish Cache is also distributed in third party package repositories.

.. _`Fedora EPEL`: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL

* `Fedora EPEL`_ does community packaging of Varnish Cache.

* RedHat has packaged versions of Varnish Cache available since Software Collections 2.1. Announcement on <http://developers.redhat.com/blog/2015/11/17/software-collections-2-1-generally-available/>.
