Installing Varnish
==================

.. no section heading here.

With open source software, you can choose to install binary packages or compile
it yourself from source code. To install a package or compile from source is a
matter of personal taste. If you don't know which method to choose, we
recommend that you read this whole section and then choose the method you feel
most comfortable with.

Unfortunately, something as basic as installing a piece of software
is highly operating system specific:

.. toctree::
	:maxdepth: 2

	install_debian
	install_freebsd
	install_openbsd
	install_redhat

Cloud images of Varnish
=======================

Compiling Varnish from source
=============================

If there are no binary packages available for your system, or if you
want to compile Varnish from source for other reasons:
