# This file helps set up a varnishtest execution without a traditional
# pre-defined list of tests. Test cases are expected to be located in a
# tests/ directory relative to the Makefile's source directory.
#
# When a difference is detected, a refresh is triggered by calling the
# vtc-refresh-tests target that must be defined in the including Makefile.
#
# The current assumption is that all the tests for the Makefile are VTCs
# and may be revisited if needed.
