	This is *NOT* a RST file but the syntax has been chosen so
	that it may become an RST file at some later date.

.. varnish_vsc_begin::	lck
	:oneliner:	Lock Counters
	:order:		70

	Counters which track the activity in the different classes
	of mutex-locks.

	The counts may be slightly wrong if there are more than one
	lock instantiated in each class (ie: .creat > 1)

.. varnish_vsc:: creat
	:type:	counter
	:level:	debug
	:oneliner:	Created locks


.. varnish_vsc:: destroy
	:type:	counter
	:level:	debug
	:oneliner:	Destroyed locks


.. varnish_vsc:: locks
	:type:	counter
	:level:	debug
	:oneliner:	Lock Operations


.. varnish_vsc:: dbg_busy
	:type:	counter
	:level:	debug
	:oneliner:	Contended lock operations

	If the ``lck`` debug bit is set: Lock operations which
	returned EBUSY on the first locking attempt.

	If the ``lck`` debug bit is unset, this counter will never be
	incremented even if lock operations are contended.

.. varnish_vsc:: dbg_try_fail
	:type:	counter
	:level:	debug
	:oneliner:	Contended trylock operations

	If the ``lck`` debug bit is set: Trylock operations which
	returned EBUSY.

	If the ``lck`` debug bit is unset, this counter will never be
	incremented even if lock operations are contended.

.. varnish_vsc_end::	lck
